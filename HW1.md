1. True or false:
a. {{a, b}} ⊆ {{a, b, c}}
b. {{a, b}, {b, a, c}} = {{b, a}, {c, c, a, b}, {a, a, b}}
c. {a, c} ∈ {{a, b}, c, {a, c}}
2. Compute the result of these operations:
({a, b} ∪ {b, c}) ∩ {a, c, d}
3. Compute the result of this composition of two relations:
{(a, b),(b, c),(a, d)} ◦ {(b, c),(c, d),(b, f),(d, f)}
